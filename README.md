## About me

I'm a student of media computer science at TU Dresden.
My interests are Photography, Design, Music and Productivity. Oh, and I love free and open source software.

## :telescope: Learning
In extent to the courses in university, I'm learning a lot about web communication, design of user interfaces with Qt and the linux system.

## :gear: My projects
Currently, I'm working a lot on Yin-Yang to improve extensibility and user experience.
Another project is a Telegram bot, which should give you all information a student in Dresden would need. This goes from the current meal at the Mensa to basic information about the different courses (important webpages, contacts, etc).

## :globe_with_meridians: Interesting web pages I stumbled upon

| URL | Description
| --- | --- |
| deepl.com | Translator based on GPT-2, which works in my experience way better than Goolge Translator
| keybr.com | Touch typing trainer based on an AI that creates non-existing words based on your mistakes

I think I discovered most of these websites through [r/InternetIsBeautiful](https://www.reddit.com/r/InternetIsBeautiful/), you might want to have a look at it.
